### Account Manager - 1 click login
Also saves your previously logged in account and allows you to set a keybind to quickly login with the last account you used. Original idea for saved login details taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2004lostcityrs/comments/1mvupbs/tampermonkey_autofill_for_rs2004_login/)
