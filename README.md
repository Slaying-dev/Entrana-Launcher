## Entrana Launcher for Lost City

Goal for the project is to make a dead simple, minimalist launcher for Lost City. No traditional runescape client sidebars, no popup windows. Everything you need, and nothing you don't in the menu bar.

- 90 Second Idle Timer with notifications
- Session Timer in either Game Ticks or Real Time
- Detail select
- World Select with player count and region
- Screenshots
- Warnings for changing detail, world, or closing the launcher if you are currently logged in.
